to remove: ['user_has_highlight_reels', 'media_comment_numbers', 'media_comments_are_disabled', 'media_has_location_info', 'media_hashtag_numbers']

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do: 
Separately: 
- collect the above features from followers in our own accounts
- create a classifier for automated accounts first (we can just run the bot classifier on our following or something)

linear classifier 306 correct, out of 350 , accuracy: 0.8742857142857143
MLP 303 correct out of 350 , accuracy: 0.8657142857142858
